  First, there is only one equal sign instead of two in the if's condition, which means userAge will be assigned the value of zero rather than userAge being compared to zero. The second fault is the semicolon at the end of the lineâ€”statements such as if and loops such as for and while don't require semicolons. The general rule is that if the statement has an associated block (that is, code in curly braces) then no semicolon is needed. So the line should be
if (userAge == 0)
The next two faults are with these lines:
else if ( userAge < 0 | userAge > 200)
   alert("I think you may be lying about your age");
else
The junior programmer's condition is asking if userAge is less than zero OR userAge is greater than 200.
 The correct operator for a Boolean OR is ||, but the programmer has only used one |. Secondly, the alert() function should to be inside a block, which we indicate with curly braces.
else if ( userAge < 0 || userAge > 200)
{
   alert("I think you may be lying about your age");
}
else

  <h1> JAVASCRIPT QUESTIONS - WEEK 3 - TAIJAH </h1>
<div>

<div>
  Q1 : First, there is only one equal sign instead of two in the if's condition, which means userAge will be assigned the value of zero rather than userAge being compared to zero. The second fault is the semicolon at the end of the line—statements such as if and loops such as for and while don't require semicolons. The general rule is that if the statement has an associated block (that is, code in curly braces) then no semicolon is needed. So the line should be
if (userAge == 0)
The next two faults are with these lines:
else if ( userAge < 0 | userAge > 200)
   alert("I think you may be lying about your age");
else
The junior programmer's condition is asking if userAge is less than zero OR userAge is greater than 200.
 The correct operator for a Boolean OR is ||, but the programmer has only used one |. Secondly, the alert() function should to be inside a block, which we indicate with curly braces.
else if ( userAge < 0 || userAge > 200)
{
   alert("I think you may be lying about your age");
}
else

  Question 2 :

  Click <a href="JSQuestionsWeek3/ch3Q2.html"> Here </a> to see timesTable

  <p>  We use a for loop to calculate from 1 * 12 up to 12 * 12. The results are written to the page with document.write().
    What's important to note here is the effect of the order of precedence; the concatenation operator
     (the +) has a lower order of precedence than the multiplication operator, *.
    This means that the timesBy * timesTable is done before the concatenation,
    which is the result we want. If this were not the case, we'd have to put the calculation in
    parentheses to raise its order of precedence.<p>

  question 3 
  <html>
  <body>
  <script language=JavaScript>
  function writeTimesTable(timesTable, timesByStart, timesByEnd)
  {
     for (;timesByStart <= timesByEnd; timesByStart++)
     {
        document.write(timesTable + " * " + timesByStart + " = " +
           timesByStart * timesTable + "<br>");
     }
  }

  writeTimesTable(4,4,9);
  </script>
  </body>
  </html>

  We've declared our function, calling it writeTimesTable(), and given it three parameters. The first is the times table we want to write,
   the second is the start point, and the third is the number it should go up to.
  We've modified our for loop. First we don't need to initialize any variables, so the initialization
   part is left blank—we still need to put a semicolon in, but there's no code before it.
   The for loop continues while the timesByStart parameter is less than or equal to the timesByEnd parameter. You can see that, as with a variable, we can modify parameters—in this case, timesByStart is incremented by one for each iteration through the loop.
  The code to display the times table is much the same. For the function's code to be executed,
   we now actually need to call it, which we do in the line
  writeTimesTable(4,4,9);
  This will write the 4 times table starting at four times four and ending at nine times four.
